# "Machine Learning" Notes:
  ## 1. Supervised Learning:  
      In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
      ### 1.a Regression:  
          In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 
      ### 1.b Classification:
          In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
